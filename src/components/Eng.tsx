Introduction
<br />
<br />
Hello dear reader, I invite you to enter the world of a happy family. It&#39;s time to get to
know the cultural family and marriage better. Today, everyone who wants to create their
own &quot;safe haven&quot; needs practical wisdom more than ever, because this is a project that
extends in life, and in turn, I will try to convey to you all practical advice, no doubt with
extensive use, so you need to concentrate and tune in correctly to an in-depth study of
many of the issues encountered in all happy projects, with a wonderful family name.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 1: the beginning.</h2>
<br />
<p>There comes a wonderful time of acquaintance, mutual sympathy, delight and endless
love, and it seems that only he (she) understands you and only he (she) is the dearest
person who will always be there. Feelings go off scale and a feeling of deep awe cannot
be endured for you, and of course, you are not parting for a second. Undoubtedly you
are sure (s) that it should always be so <br />...
<br />
<br />
Preparatory stage.
<br />
<br />
Young people still meet in love euphoria and look forward to the day when they are
already together, and therefore every meeting becomes sweeter and more languid.
None of them yet thinks about what is expected of them, because further from each of
their decisions and actions depends on their exceptional life. &quot;What a man sees, he
reaps&quot; - this is a generally accepted rule for everyone and for the entire distance of life,
but those who are in love are not in places of reflection, and yet they just need to control
their relationships and already be observant, and evaluate other people solely on
personal qualities, because, as in this case, emotions can only hurt ...
<br />
<br />
What can be done? Ask yourself: sincerely your future spouse?
<br />
<br />
Does he/she often take seriously the extent of the impact on their decisions?
<br />
<br />
What qualities will be given to my chosen one (chosen one)?
<br />
<br />
Do you really need this relationship?
<br />
<br />
Does he have a clear plan?
<br />
<br />
How does it relate to my parents?
<br />
<br />
Does he/she understand what true love is?
<br />
<br />
Does he/she have humility?
<br />
<br />
Does he treat me with respect?
<br />
<br />
Can he/she control himself/herself?
<br />
<br />
Does he/she admit his mistakes?
<br />
<br />
Does he/she love children?
<br />
<br />
Does he/she have bad habits?
<br />
<br />
Am I ready (a) to create my happy union with this person?</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
<br />
<p>Wedding, marriage certificate.
<br />
<br />
Have you already found a life partner, or are you ready to take responsibility for others?
It seems that an inner voice says that this is exactly the person and you can&#39;t imagine
life without him, but, fortunately, this is usually not yet a proven feeling, based only on
passion, maybe passion, or emotions, and around they say: &quot;listen to your heart or inner
voice&quot;, but practice shows that the heart is wrong, and quite often, however, like the
inner voice, therefore, it is always necessary to approach the choice very seriously and
thoughtfully, consulting with experts in this field, with those who have lived, who has and
applies practical wisdom! A registered marriage is undoubtedly respect for oneself, for a
companion, for relatives, it is respect for the law! Practice: many people, ignoring these
principles, reap bitter fruits, because what a person sows, he reaps and this is true.
Someone may argue that it is not profitable for him to register, but there is a marriage
contract for this if you want.
<br />
<br />
... if you have weighed everything and the matter goes to the wedding, then do not
hesitate to legitimize your relationship. Then remember that you are starting a blessed
path in the world of the family and what kind of family will depend only on you, yes, yes,
on you ... You, undoubtedly, must discuss a lot, but not traditions, but your life together,
because family is pleasant joint work of both parties, and know that you and he (a) from
the date of entry into a legal marriage are closer than you are to each other and should
not be and this is a life-long rule, but, of course, this does not mean that there are no
relatives and friends beside you, on the contrary, your relatives are with you and
support you, but your family is your family, so the parents of a young family should not
get into your family, except perhaps with advice ..., and this is the rule. Respect the
opinion of the companion always. Listen to each other, because you grew up in different
families and maybe in different cultures, so slowly begin to cultivate the good qualities in
yourself that are necessary to create a full-fledged, happy family.
<br />
<br />
So, you made an agreement for life and made a vow to each other, where you swore to
love and support each other until death separates you, which means not to betray each
other, to always be together and create &quot;your own world.&quot; Remember that you did not

make empty promises, but firm, sincere vows to your beloved. What questions are
relevant at the beginning: what awaits you after marriage? What assets does the young
family have? Will we be able to meet our current needs? What are our future plans? Will
we be able to create comfortable conditions for future children?
<br />
<br />
Where will we live? If with whom, how do you imagine it?</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<br />
<p>The role of parents.
<br />
<br />
I appeal to the parents of future parents and hope for mutual understanding, respect
and cooperation. The fact is that it is your actions at the beginning of the path of a
young family that its future fate depends on. You must understand that even if this is a
young family, it needs constant support, and not criticism and reproaches, and in no
case should you take sides in contentious issues, and consider the current situation
unilaterally, but on the contrary try to be as objective and friendly as possible,
remembering that you can cause irreparable damage to someone else&#39;s family, yes, you
did not disobey, this is no longer your family, but you, as people who have gone through
many stages in the development of your family, are obliged to instruct them on the right
path, i.e. as far as possible, to preserve the family, because you, in turn, agreed to this
family marriage. The time has come to act in accordance with these agreements of both
parents and young people, and this should remain a principle for life. Remember dear
parents, also everything can change dramatically from your advice. Be builders, not
destroyers, of your children&#39;s happiness. Respect both parties and remain reasonable in
any situation.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<br />
<p>Love, deep respect, humility, responsibility and duties, are the qualities that are needed
in a family and you simply have to develop them and work on them if you sincerely wish
for happiness! After all, happiness comes to those who rush to it! But first, you need to
understand this well. Love - what is it? Love is not just emotions associated with a flutter
of the heart or hormones that sometimes push us to rash acts, but absolutely more than
just an attraction based on &quot;eros&quot;, or on banal whims and selfishness. Love is a deep
feeling, consisting of facets of honour, deep respect for the needs of your companion,
ready to forgive and always be there, to be a true friend, ready to support at any second
and undoubtedly devotion, insight and mutual understanding ... Even if you like your
position &quot; halves&quot; this does not mean that you should leave everything to chance and be
offended every time ... On the contrary, you simply have to smooth out all urgent issues
as soon as possible, so communicate and address each other respectfully. Be generous
and calm in contentious matters, keep peace in relationships as much as possible, and
take these tips as principles to help you build your happiness, because
family is the main success in life. There is no evil, no greed, no selfishness, no jealousy,
no revenge, no criticism, and no self-interest in love, remember this!</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<br />
<p>The role of the father in the family.
<br />
<br />
In any company or organization, there must be one head, so that it doesn&#39;t turn out like
a fable ...
<br />
<br />
The head should not be despotic and harsh, but on the contrary, be gentle and
consistent in his actions, love passionately and make decisions together, consulting
within the family. He can be strict when necessary, while taking into account the
opinions of other family members, just as in any successful company, the head makes
decisions taking into account the opinions of all subordinates. A diligent head is obliged
to respect the opinion of his half in all matters. A good head is always ready to listen
and teach and serve everyone in the family, always available and a good organizer, and
an excellent manager who knows how to drive the family budget, and this is also the
main principle for the success of a happy family life.
<br />
<br />
Different circumstances can arise in life, and even then, sometimes you think that she is
deeply wrong.
<br />
<br />
Advice: what not to do? - Under no circumstances should a man shout back, let alone
raise his hand to a woman, even if the woman is not right and this is the principle.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<br />
<p>The role of the mother in the family.
<br />
<br />
The wife, in turn, is obliged to love and deeply respect her husband, and not to look for
flaws and shortcomings in him, but to find virtues and celebrate them in front of the
children, then this will help to establish the authority of both dad and mother in the
family. A good wife is submissive and never questions her husband&#39;s qualities in front of
her children, especially in front of others, just as a husband should not humiliate his
wife&#39;s dignity. Do not let external factors influence the climate in the family under any
circumstances. Remember that you chose him to create your wonderful world together.
Coordinate your decision and the upbringing of your children together. All this in total
will only benefit the whole family.
<br />
<br />
But it may happen that the husband really did not do the right thing.
<br />
<br />
Tip: Avoid harsh statements and accusations. You can&#39;t raise your voice to your spouse,
especially in front of others, and even more so to raise your hand to your spouse. This
does not honour either you or your spouse, and this is the principle.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<br />
<p>Children in the family.
<br />
<br />
So we got to the biggest people in the family - children! Children are a delicate matter,
so you always need to be delicate, attentive and kind to them. Children should not
belong to the street or school, they should always be in the field of visibility and
upbringing. Children learn from their parents what is good and what is bad, and they not
only listen to you but also watch you, so watch what you say, how you teach and how
you act. From early childhood instil in them the right good qualities and manners. Do not
criticize them often and do not compare them with anyone, but try to see in him a full-
fledged person. In no case does not cultivate anger, greed, envy, jealousy and
insecurity in him. When you make a promise, keep it. When necessary, be strict and be
sure to explain to him his offence. Do not be boring, but try to get his location, be always
honest and open, and frank. Never condone or indulge their whims. Communicate with
them often. Children, be obedient to your parents and keep a deep respect for them
because you have appeared thanks to their love. Remember that Mom and Dad are
your best friends. They always care and love you. Sometimes it may seem that parents
will not understand for sure, but, fortunately, this is not the case, because these are just
your guesses. Try to ask for advice at an opportunity, or just share your thoughts, and
feelings with your parents, trust them always, and this is the principle.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<br />
<p>Childless family.
<br />
<br />
Situations in this world are different, not similar to each other, but remember that there
is always a choice and there is a way out of any situation, and the main thing is to make
the right choice. Unfortunately, it happens that for a number of reasons one of the
spouses cannot have children ... This does not mean at all that it all ended there,
fortunately, this is a delusion, because the family always initially consists of two people,
so you should never despair but show patience. Fortunately, today there are many
options, one of which is the adoption and adoption of a child. Much depends on how
you treat each other. How are you prepared to deal with difficulties and obstacles
together? But believe me, many of these families live quite happily and prosperously,
because different families have their pros and cons, and it depends on you how many
pluses there will be! Remember that the physical handicap of your companion is not a
reason for disagreement, especially for a divorce. Continue to be loyal and love each
other dearly, and this is important because you are worthy people!</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<br />
<p>The role of relatives, friends, and colleagues.
<br />
<br />
Sometimes all these personalities who one way or another are nearby can both help
and harm your family, so you need to clearly limit the boundaries of permitted rules and
principles for everyone. And relatives, friends, and colleagues should respect the values of this family and not meddle with advice and reproaches in someone else&#39;s life, and
this is the principle. Everyone may think that they know this or that side or situation
better, but no one knows how to read other people&#39;s thoughts and fully know all the
circumstances, so never rush to condemn or tell others, because gossip is never good.
Show respect to the other family and try to be objective and decent at all times.
Remember that your advice can destroy someone else&#39;s happy world.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 10</h2>
<br />
<p>Planning and raising children.
<br />
<br />
The appearance of a child should always please, but also increases your obligations
and responsibilities. Today&#39;s world dictates its own rules and opportunities, therefore, it
is advisable to plan children, but in any case, the birth of a child must be discussed
together, but unplanned pregnancy happens, and this is also good. And I would like to
note that a child is always welcome in a family, regardless of whether it is planned or
not, so it&#39;s better not to even allow yourself to think about an abortion! Wise parents will
try together and prepare in advance for such an event! Remember that a child is
influenced not only by the upbringing of the parents, but by their marital relations, the
locality, and the society in which you live. From birth, a child cannot determine what is
good and what is bad, he still cannot make the right decisions and choices on his own,
and this is the duty of the parents to explain to the baby and at the same time show love
and patience, tenderness and care. Communicate more with the baby, read useful
books together and pay more attention to him, but do not forget - excessive care can
harm the development of your child&#39;s personality. Try not to annoy the children, but
communicate in a friendly, simple way. Teach your child to analyze situations and make
the right decisions without criticism and insults. Do not teach children cruelty and
revenge. Be his friend at all times, but don&#39;t be patient with him, this can lead to
selfishness, excessive pride, infantilism and rebelliousness. Set a time limit for
communication with Androids, and modern gadgets. Always find time for him, and play
together more often. Instil love for animals and a friendly attitude towards others. Do not
forget that the child needs to observe everywhere and always be cautious and attentive,
respectful and kind. Define the limits of personal space and the limits of what is
permitted so that your child can make the right decision without you, and this principle
can save him from many difficulties and misunderstandings. All of these rules apply to
adopted children as well. Raising foster children is a huge responsibility, patience and

work. Never separate them, always treat adopted children as if they were your own.
Look for something to praise them for, it is important for them. Always be discerning in
dealing with them. Be reasonable even when you are angry.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<br />
<p>Difficulties, illnesses, alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, today no one is immune from diseases and other human weaknesses...
<br />
<br />
What can be done? Many diseases, like alcoholism, drug addiction and the desire for
gambling, are easier to prevent than to deal with the consequences. Learn to say no
when necessary. If you see in yourself this or that inclination, resolutely avoid it. Stop all
communication that can somehow negatively affect you and cause these harmful
desires. Remember that for every step you take, you are responsible to your family and
to yourself. Always be vigilant at all times. You have to control the situation, not you,
and this is the principle that can save your life. If someone in the family falls ill, be ready
to take care of them at any time. If your spouse is sick, show devotion around the clock,
because he (a) was next to you when it was not easy for you either and you made a
vow of marriage to each other, and this is the principle.

<br />
Undoubtedly, family marriage is a joint work of all family members. Everything that
happens in the world is the result of the upbringing of the family and society. Everything
revolves around the family and much is created for it. I appeal to every member of the
family: Use all these practical tips, and constantly learn to create, not destroy. Think of
the needs of your neighbour more than of yourself. Always be considerate of others and
respect other opinions.
<br />
<br />
Do not idealize anyone, but strive for this and love each other with open love, because
there is no benefit from hidden love, and all this in total will undoubtedly give your family
happiness and well-being! With deep respect, the author.</p>
